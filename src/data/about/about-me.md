Hello! My name is Evgeniy and I’m a front-end developer. I’m 29 years old. I was born in Kazakhstan, but now I live and work in Kyiv.

Back in school, I became interested in programming, namely web development, and began to study it. I applied my programming skills during the creation of the website for my school.

After graduation, I decided to learn programming deeply and entered the National Transport University in Kyiv (Computer Science faculty). But as many of you might have experienced, university does not teach you what you will need for a job. That’s why I began to study front-end technologies in details by myself. At that time, there were no such popular frameworks as Angular, VueJS or React library. Therefore, I was studying VanillaJS.

Today I have chosen React as a main tool for developing because of its flexibility depending on variable projects. But at the same time I am open to exploring other frameworks, as I find using the same tool in projects wrong.

My standpoint is always bring tasks to an end. I’m hard-working, with a keen eye for details, so I strive to provide the very highest quality of an end product. And I always try to better myself with every project I work on.

Thanks for visiting my website and spending your precious time here. I am sure that our cooperation will be profitable.
